% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to

% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to

\title{Refactoring access control policies for performance improvement}


%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{5} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.

% Just remember to make sure that the TOTAL number of authors

% number that will appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\begin{abstract}
Modern access control architectures tend to separate the business logic from access control policy specification for the sake of easing authorization 
manageability. Thus, request evaluation is processed by a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that encapsulates the access control policy and interacts with the
 business logic through Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). Such architectures may engender performance bottleneck due to the number of rules that have to be 
evaluated by a single PDP at decision making time. In this paper, we propose to optimize the decision-making process by splitting the PDP into smaller decision points. 
We conducted studies on XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) to identify the best PDP splitting configuration. Our evaluation results show that
 the best splitting criterion is the one that preserves the initial architectural model in terms of interaction between the business logic and the decision engine and enables
 to reduce the time of request evaluation time by up to 9 times.
