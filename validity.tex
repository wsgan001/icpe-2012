\section{Threats to Validity} \label{sec:validity}
To find the best splitting criteria in a given application, we made assumptions that method calls are organized by the same distribution of target elements.
In our evaluation studies, rules are triggered by functions calls by the couple (Action, Resource), however, this is really related to the organization of the application code, we can find
different organizations of method calls.
